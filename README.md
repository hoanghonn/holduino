#Holduino

We wanted to make a prosthetic out of a luxury electronic. The Myo is well suited to working alongside arduino, it turns out, given the right library.

Our setup: <ol>
<li>A windows 10 laptop running myoconnect.exe (https://market.myo.com/app/54bd7403e4b00db53ad527a2/myoduino-), with an Arduino UNO hooked up to a servo motor (Parallax standard servo).</li>
<li>To install the MyoController library, unzip the MyoDuino folder, read instructions.pdf, and manually install the library by placing MyoDuino/Arduino/MyoController in Documents/Arduino/libraries.</li>
</ol> 

Download MyoDuino zip file: https://market.myo.com/app/54bd7403e4b00db53ad527a2/myoduino-
